# PIG-Project 
This Project includes H1B visa analysis for the year 2015 and 2016 using Apache PIG latin script. 
The dataset is from Kaggle on H1B visa anlaysis,
I have used that dataset to run some mapreduce jobs on Hadoop.
Hortonworks Sandbox was installed and an instance of the docker station was used to run the jobs. Hence for you to execute this code, you need to install on a system that has high computational power that is atleast 8GB RAM. Sandbox is opensource and can be deployed anywhere.
